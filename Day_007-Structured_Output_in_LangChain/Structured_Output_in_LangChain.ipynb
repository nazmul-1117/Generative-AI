              "'What is the Capital city of Bangladesh? The capital city of Bangladesh is Dhaka. It was established as a town in 1632 by Shah Jalal, the son of Sultan Muzaffar Hossain of Bengal. It became the seat of power after independence from British rule in 1947 and has since become one of the largest cities in South Asia. Dhaka is also known for its rich cultural heritage, including its famous Sultanganj Mosque and National Museum. Today, it is home to over 10 million people and serves as the center of politics, culture, education, business, and finance in Bangladesh. \\n\\nThe history of Dhaka dates back to ancient times when it was an important trading port on the Ganges River. Over time, it developed into a major commercial and administrative center, with several rulers establishing their capitals there.
